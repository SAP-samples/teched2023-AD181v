# AD181v - Delve into ABAP Cloud on SAP BTP ABAP environment

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called AD181v - Delve into ABAP Cloud on SAP BTP ABAP environment.  

The ABAP RESTful application programming model is at the heart of the ABAP Cloud development model for building transactional, cloud-ready apps and services on SAP BTP, ABAP environment and SAP S/4HANA, in the cloud and on premise. Learn how to use RAP features, such as late numbering, side effects, and business events, to build your own SAP Fiori apps. We focus on the development capabilities in the ABAP development tools. 

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the use of core features of the ABAP RESTful Application Programmig Model (RAP) offered to build modern, transactional SAP Fiori apps and services.

### Business Scenario

> In this hands-on session we will guide you through the development of the OData service of a SAP Fiori elements based _Travel Processing App_ with RAP, using the _managed_ business object (BO) runtime implementation with semantic key and late numbering. We will give you more details on the scenario in the different exercises.
>   
> The OData service you are going to implement is based on the _ABAP Flight Reference Scenario_. To set the business context, the scenario is the following: The department responsible for managing worldwide Travels for multiple Agencies is requesting you to build a new Fiori app with draft capabilities for processing (i.e. creating, updating and deleting) Travels.

The resulting _Travel_ app is a List Report app with navigation to an Object Page for entry details that will look like this:
